# Chapter 5: Recommendations for Monitoring

It is essential that you put in place proper monitoring for RadiantOne components applicable to your deployment architecture. Configuring monitoring and alerts can help administrators stay abreast of the system health and reduce security risks by notifying them when the state of critical services change (are stopped or restarted). Details on monitoring can be found in the RadiantOne Monitoring and Reporting Guide.
