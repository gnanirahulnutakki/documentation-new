# Define Attribute Priority

For an example of the need for attribute priority, see [Attribute Priority](#_VUID) in the Concepts section.

If multiple identity sources publish values to the same global profile attribute (defined in the attribute mapping), you can define attribute priority/precedence.

From the main project page, select **Edit** > **Attribute Priority**.

Attribute Priority Option

Each attribute that is mapped from multiple sources is displayed in the table. Choose the attribute and the priority setting as shown on the right.

Defining Attribute Priority

In the Priority drop-down list, choose a priority level for the identity source. If all sources have the same priority, and the attribute values in each source are unique, the global profile attribute will be multi-valued, containing all source values. Otherwise, the attribute is only populated from the identity source configured with the highest priority. If the attribute doesn't have a value in the identity source configured with the highest priority, the global profile attribute is populated from the identity source configured for the next highest priority.

>[!important]
>If you change attribute priority after you've uploaded into the global profile, you must re-upload the data sources.
