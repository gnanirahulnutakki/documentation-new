# Attribute Mapping

Attribute mapping is the process of mapping identity source attributes to global profile attributes. During the upload/sync processes, the source identities are inserted/updated into the global profile store and the attribute mapping dictates how the global profile attribute values are populated. This mapping can be a direct mapping where the exact source value is mapped to a single global profile attribute value, or it can be a computed value based on one or more source attributes that get mapped to a single global profile attribute. The mapping can also indicate a constant value to be used for the global profile attribute.
