# Global Profile Browser

The Global Profile Browser is accessible after identity sources have been uploaded into the global profile. From here you can search for identities in the global profile, see all sources the user is located in, and their complete profile. You can also manually unlink overlapping entries from here.

From the main project configuration, select **Identities Browser**.
