# Registration

The custom data source example described in this section is Azure AD. RadiantOne includes a default custom data source to virtualize Azure AD. Edit this data source to point to your Azure AD. You must have an application registered in your Azure AD and have the APPLICATION ID and PASSWORD KEY before proceeding with the following steps.

>[!note]
>If you have not already registered an application in Azure AD, you must do so prior to configuring RadiantOne. If you need help registering an application, see the RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide or the Microsoft Azure AD documentation.
