# View Unresolved Identities

An unresolved identity is one that either did not match a global profile identity, or matched more than one identity in the global profile based on the correlation rules defined for the identity source.

You can view unresolved identities per identity source. From the main project page, select ![magnifying glass icon](./media/image60.png) next to the identity source.

From the drop-down list, choose **Unresolved** to just view the identities that were flagged as unresolved in this source.

Viewing Unresolved Identities

For each unresolved identity, you can view the source attributes, their current status in the global profile (Correlation Status tab), and if there are any correlation rules that would match them to a global profile identity (Rules Matches tab). You can also search the global profile to find an identity to link the user to (Link Manually tab).
