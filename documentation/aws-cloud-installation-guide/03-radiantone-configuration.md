# Chapter 3: RadiantOne Configuration

## RadiantOne Nodes Running on Linux

You can connect to any Bastion host running in any availability zone. Through the Bastion host,
you can connect to and manage any RadiantOne node. The .pem file generated when you
created the key pair in AWS must be converted to use it in your SSH session to connect to the
Bastion. The following steps describe how to use Puttygen to convert .pem files to .ppk files on
Windows clients.

1. Download PuTTY, Puttygen and Pageant.
2. Start Puttygen and select “Load”.
3. Select your .PEM file and click Open.
4. Click OK to exit the confirmation.
5. Select “Save Private Key” A passphrase is not required but can be used if additional security is required. Puttygen converts the .PEM format to .PPK format.
6. After you convert the private key, close Puttygen and run Pageant (pageant.exe).
7. To import the PuTTY-formatted key into Pageant, right-click the Pageant icon in the System tray and choose “View Keys”.

10. Click Close in the Pageant Key List window.
11. Run C:\"Program Files"\PuTTY\plink.exe -l ec2-user -N -L 7070:10.0.0.10:7070 -L 8089:10.0.0.10:8089 `<ec2DNSname>`

><span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTE – All Linux instances configured with the Cloud Formation Templates are using the ec2-user account EXCEPT for CentOS which is using centos. Use the DNS name of the bastion server for the <ec2DNSname> in the command.**

From your local machine, access the control panel on the RadiantOne node.
E.g. [http://localhost:7070/main/login](http://localhost:7070/main/login)

## RadiantOne Nodes Running on Windows

The steps in this section describe how to configure a Remote Desktop Connection to the
Remote Desktop Gateway.

1. Open Remote Desktop Connection. It should be installed by default on any Windows computer.
2. Enter the computer name (or IP address) of the RadiantOne node.

12. Click the Connect button.
13. After the remote desktop connection is established, launch a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:7070](http://localhost:7070) to launch the Main Control Panel.

## Connecting to Data Sources On-Premises

The network configuration required for connectivity to your on-premises network is not handled by the Cloud Formation Templates. Contact your Network Administrator to configure the
network between the AWS VPC and your on-premises network to ensure it complies with your corporate security policy. This would involve setting up a Customer Gateway, Virtual Private
Gateway, and VPN connection.
