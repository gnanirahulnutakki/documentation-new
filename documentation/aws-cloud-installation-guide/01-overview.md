# RadiantOne AWS Cloud Installation Guide

## Chapter 1: Overview Contents

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 is hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These locations are composed of Regions and Availability Zones. Each independent region is a separate geographic area and has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. Radiant Logic offer templates to assist with deploying RadiantOne in a Virtual
Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon EC2.

Since the RadiantOne Main Control Panel and Server Control Panel are web-based, all configurations from these interfaces work fine in the default Amazon environment.

><span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTES – the cloud deployment templates provided by Radiant Logic, Inc install an approved and supported RadiantOne Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture. This is to ensure that RadiantOne is deployed on a certified architecture. If the provided templates do not meet your needs, please contact support@radiantlogic.com and they will work with your Radiant Logic Account Manager to assess the required professional services needed (if any) to alter the default templates. If you deploy a customized architecture without using the certified templates, the Radiant Logic support team might be unable to resolve problems in a timely manner. This can result in additional consultation fees imposed on the customer related to the time required to assess and certify the custom deployment.**
