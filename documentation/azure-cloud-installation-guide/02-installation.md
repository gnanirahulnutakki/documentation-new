# Chapter 2: Installation

Radiant Logic offers templates for the following types of RadiantOne architectures:

- Single server
- 3 node cluster
- 5 node cluster

Templates are available for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5, CentOS 7.6, or Windows Server 2016 as the host operating system.

><span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTES – the templates provided by Radiant Logic install an approved and supported RadiantOne Azure architecture. This is to ensure that RadiantOne is deployed on a certified architecture. If the provided templates do not meet your needs, please contact support@radiantlogic.com and they will
work with your Radiant Logic Account Manager to assess the required professional services needed (if any) to alter the default templates.**

><span style="color:red">**If you deploy a customized architecture without using the certified templates, the Radiant Logic support team might be unable to resolve problems in a timely manner. This can result in additional consultation fees imposed on the customer related to the time required to assess and certify the custom deployment.**

All templates install and configure one [load balancer](#load-balancer) and a remote desktop gateway/jumpbox for secure administrative access. A high-level diagram for a three-node cluster deployment is shown below.

There is no external access allowed to the RadiantOne service on the non-SSL LDAP port.

The templates install self-signed SSL/TLS certificates based on the internal server name that Azure assigns to each node. You can update the environment with CA-signed certificates after the install.

27. Enter the HTTPS port for the RadiantOne service to accept client requests on. This is also the HTTPS port configured in the load balancer. All client requests go through the load balancer on the HTTPS port (or LDAPS port mentioned in the previous step). The non-SSL HTTP port is not configurable in the template and defaults to 8089. There is no external access allowed to the RadiantOne service on the non-SSL HTTP port.
28. Click the OK button to advance to the Summary page.
29. Review the parameters.
30. Click OK.
31. Click Create.

### Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines

To view the virtual machines, click Resource groups on the menu on the left. Click the resource in the Name column. The Name and Type columns indicate if it is a RadiantOne server (e.g. rli-server-0), a remote desktop gateway server (gateway), load balancer (lb-radiantone), and so on.

![An image showing ](Media/Image2.5.jpg)

### Ports Opened

The following ports are opened during the configuration.

- The load balancer listens on the ports LDAPS (1636 by default) and HTTPS (8090 by default), the CIDR IP is 0.0.0.0/0. These ports are configurable in the parameters.
- Azure virtual machines can communicate in between each other on any port.
- On Linux, the jumpbox is accessible on port 22 (SSH) from the CIDR IP provided in theparameter Administration Location of the resource creation process.
- On Windows, the Remove Desktop Gateway is accessible on port 443 (HTTPS) from the CIDR IP provided in the parameter Administration Location of the Cloud Formation Stack. There is also a temporary port 3389 (RDP) opened but must be removed
manually in post deployment.

### Load Balancer

The Microsoft Azure load balancer automatically scales its request handling capacity to meet the demands of application traffic. Additionally, load balancing offers integration with Auto Scaling to ensure that you have back-end capacity to meet varying levels of traffic levels without requiring manual intervention. The RadiantOne templates install one load balancer. Client applications should query the load balancer to reach the RadiantOne service. The load balancer distributes client load across RadiantOne cluster nodes.

To view the settings for the load balancer configured, from Resource Groups, select your resource group in the Name column. Locate the load balancer and click the link in the Name column.

In the overview, you can see the public IP address for the load balancer. This is what client applications should point to, to use the RadianOne service.

### Remote Desktop Gateway/Jumpbox

A remote desktop gateway (on Windows) or jumpbox (on Linux), is a special purpose server instance that is designed to be the primary access point from the Internet and acts as a proxy to your other Azure virtual machines.

To view the settings for jumpbox servers configured, from the Favorites menu on the left, select Resource Groups. Click on the Resource Group name link, and then click the “gateway” (“jumpbox” in Linux environments) link. Take note of the IP address as you will need it to connect to the gateway.

![An image showing ](Media/Image2.7.jpg)

### Post-Deployment Tasks (Windows Server Only)

Perform the following instructions to complete the configuration of your Azure environment.

1. Install a valid SSL certificate on the remote desktop gateway server. This certificate should be trusted on the administrative client machine.
2. In your resource group, click “lb-radiantone”.
3. Select inbound NAT rules.
4. Right click "loadBalancer-inbound-nat-rdp-temporary” and click Delete.
