# Chapter 3: RadiantOne Configuration

## RadiantOne Nodes Running on Linux

Through the jumpbox, you can connect to and manage any RadiantOne node.

?**Note – the RadiantOne service and the Jetty web server hosting the Main Control Panel are configured to automatically startup as services.**

1. Use the SSH key you provided during the configuration to establish a tunnel connection to the RadiantOne node that you want to manage through the jumpbox server.

    E.g. (on a Windows client, using Putty):
    ```
    `Run C:\"Program Files"\PuTTY\plink.exe -l <username> -N -L 7070:rli-server-0:7070 -L`
    8089:rli-server-0:8089 <jumpbox_IP_address>
```
2. From your local machine, access the control panel on the RadiantOne node. E.g. [http://localhost:7070/main/login](http://localhost:7070/main/login)

## Connecting to Data Sources On-Premises

The network configuration required for connectivity to your on-premises network is not handled by the templates. Contact your Network Administrator to configure the network between the Azure VPC and your on-premises network to ensure it complies with your corporate security policy. For guidance, see:
