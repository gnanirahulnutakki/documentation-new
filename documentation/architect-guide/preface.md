# Preface

## About this Manual

The focus of this guide is to:

- Introduce the different challenges that the RadiantOne platform addresses.
- Introduce ways to architect the solution while taking into account specific security requirements for authentication and authorization.

This guide is primarily for architects in charge of designing the solution to match the use case at hand. Although this document would be a valuable introduction for a RadiantOne administrator, it does not describe any step-by-step configuration details. This type of information is detailed in the [RadiantOne System Administration Guide](/sys-admin-guide/01-introduction) and [RadiantOne Namespace Configuration Guide](/namespace-configuration-guide/01-introduction).
References to other relevant RadiantOne documentation are included throughout this guide.

## Audience

- LDAP
- SQL
- General knowledge regarding the structure of a directory information tree (DIT)
