# Target DN Variable

The target DN can either be automatically generated, or you can control the value manually. This is determined by the option selected for [Target DN Generation](../advanced-options.md#target-dn-generation) in the ADVANCED OPTIONS section for the Rule Set. When the **Manual** option is selected, you see a Target DN Variable property in the BASIC INFORMATION section of the Rule. You need a [variable defined](variable-configuration.md) that computes the value of the target DN before you can configure the Target DN Variable in the BASIC INFORMATION section as outlined below.

1. For a selected rule, choose the **BASIC INFORMATION** tab.
1. Select the variable that contains the target DN value from the **Target DN Variable** drop-down list. This list is populated with all variables you have defined.
1. Select **OK**.
