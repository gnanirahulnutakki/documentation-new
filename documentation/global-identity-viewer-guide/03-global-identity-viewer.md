#  Using Global Identity Viewer

After the configuration outlined in Chapter 2 is completed, the Global Identity Viewer can be used. Any user that is a member of RadiantOne Directory Administrator, Global ID Viewer Design, Global ID Viewer Write or Read Only roles can log into the Global Identity Viewer Console and access the Global Identity Viewer. For details on the RadiantOne delegated admin roles, see the RadiantOne System Administration Guide.

To access the Global Identity Viewer, append `/portal` to the end of the Control Panel endpoint as follows.

`https://<hostname>/portal`

For example:

`https://cp-rliqa.dc.federated-identity.com/portal`

>[!note]The endpoint for Control Panel can be located in the Environment Details section in Environment Operations Center. ![Global Identity Viewer endpoint](Media/endpoint.png)

Enter your credentials and click Login.

If you have more than one Global Identity Builder project, a drop-down list appears for you to
select the one to use. Otherwise, you are shown the main search page.

## Browsing Identities

By default, the first 100 entries from the global profile are returned. Click on one entry and the profile of the identity is displayed on the Global Profile tab. Additional tabs are displayed to represent each underlying data source the identity is found in. The names of the additional tabs correspond to the names of the identity sources defined in the Global Identity Builder project.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.4.jpg)

Figure 3.30: Example Global Profile Identity

Select a tab to view the identity’s attributes and group membership contained in that particular source. In the example below, the user Brian Carmen’s account in the Active Directory Partner Domain (identified as identity source adpartnerdomain) is displayed. Specific attributes are displayed based on the template associated with the data source. This particular template returns the names of the groups Brian is a member of as the Roles attribute (e.g. Support and Managers).

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.5.jpg)

Figure 3.4 : Example of Viewing an Account in a Specific Identity Source

## Templates

The default templates display entries/attributes from data sources based on the mappings
described in the table below.

| Object Class | Displayed Attribute | Mapped Attribute(s) | 
|------------|------------|--------| 
User | Name | cn
| | Photo | jpegphoto
| | Phone | homephone
| | Email | mail
| | Mobile | mobile
| | Manager | manager
| | Title | title
| | City | l
Group | Name | cn
| | Manager | managedBy
| | Description | Description
| | Members | Member

If the data in a virtual view does not match the object classes listed in the table above, a general
template is used to display the attributes in a basic table format using the exact source attribute
name(s) and value(s). An example is shown below.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.6.jpg)

Figure 3. 6 : Default Generic Template

If a template has been [customized](#editing-templates) in the Global Identity Viewer, it is saved and used for
displaying results for subsequent queries.

### Template Access Requirements

The Editor View page currently contains two template types. To access these templates, users require the following:

- Sufficient access permissions (see the [Define Access Permissions](02-configuration.md#define-access-permissions) section for more information).
- Belong to the Global ID Viewer Design group (cn=Global ID Viewer Design,ou=globalgroups,cn=config) or any group in the RadiantOne namespace that has vdPrivilege= globalidviewer-designer)

These templates, available in a dropdown menu on the Editor View page, are described below.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.7.jpg)

Figure 3. 7 : The Editor View Page’s Template Drop - down Menu

### Display Templates

Display templates are available for the global profile tab as well as the data source tabs. These templates control the appearance and arrangement of the content in the Profile Info section of the Global Identity Viewer. Display templates are generated automatically based on the object class in the view definition. If there is an existing display template for the object class, the Global Identity Viewer renders that template. If there is no template, the Global Identity Viewer generates a default display template based on the object class of the entry.

For information on how to edit a display template, see the [Editing Display Templates](#editing-display-templates) section.

### Modify Templates

Like display templates, modify templates allow you to control the appearance and arrangement of the content in the Profile Info section of the Global Identity Viewer. However, modify templates also allow users to update profile attribute values in the Global Identity Viewer. These changes are propagated to the backend data source. Modify Templates are available on data source tabs only; attribute values cannot be edited from the Global Profile tab. In order to update attribute values, the logged in user must belong to the Global ID Viewer Write group, or any group in FID that has vdPrivilege=globalidviewer-write and have write permissions assigned in [RadiantOne ACL’s on the identity source virtual view](02-configuration.md#define-access-permissions).

>[!note] 
>If a source attribute is mapped to the global profile, and the persistent cache refresh is running, a modification to a source attribute in the Global Identity Viewer, should also be reflected on the Global Profile tab for the entry.

To make attribute values editable, a modify template must first be defined for the data source. A user that belongs to the Global ID Viewer Design group (or any group in the RadiantOne namespace that has vdPrivilege=globalidviewer-designer) must define a Modify Template for the identity source. Once a template is defined, attribute values can be modified only in Template View (attribute values are read-only in Attributes View).

>[!note] 
>Some attributes are read-only, even if a modify template is defined. These read-only attributes include binary attributes (e.g. photo and userpassword) and attributes that are the result of a computation or lookup (e.g. group members, manager, and owner).

For more information on how to edit a modify template, see the [Editing Modify Templates](#editing-modify-templates)
section.

### Editing Templates

The templates used for displaying entries can be edited. If a [default template](#templates) is provided, and changes are made, a copy of the default template is saved and associated with the underlying virtual view and the default template remains untouched.

While viewing the results of a selected entry, click Edit Templates. This displays the template currently in use. A template can be comprised of different elements such as components, columns and separators. To use an element, drag it from the toolbox on the right to the template area on the left. The components are outlined in the table below.

| Component | Description |  
|------------|------------| 
![An image showing ](Media/label.jpg) | Label <br> ![An image showing ](Media/label2.jpg) <br> Labels allow you to indicate a human-friendly display name and corresponding source attribute mapping.
![An image showing ](Media/Image.jpg) | Image <br> ![An image showing ](Media/Image2.jpg) <br> Images allow you to indicate a picture/photo should be shown in the template.
![An image showing ](Media/Map.jpg) | Map <br> ![An image showing ](Media/Map2.jpg) <br>  Maps allow you to display the location of an entry on a map. The Google maps API is used.

If an entry isn’t associated with a custom template, a default template is used.

### Auto Generate Templates

To create a default template that contains every attribute found in the source schema, click the Auto Generate button. This button is displayed only when the existing template has been cleared.

## Searching Identities and Groups

Searches performed in the Global Identity Viewer are performed against the data source
selected in the drop-down list. All searches can be saved, modified, or deleted.

>[!note] 
>The logged in user must be associated with a role that has either the globalidviewer-write or globalidviewer-designer privilege in order to save, modify or delete search queries.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.15.jpg)

Figure 3. 15 : Search Option

The search results page displays the results from the query in a list on the left side. The result
can be either identities and/or groups that match the search criteria. When searching against
the global profile data source, only identities are returned in the search result. Groups are not
stored in the global profile list. To search for groups, select a data source from the drop-down
list that contains the group entries. An example of searching for groups is shown below. The
Description contains information about what the members of the group are authorized to do.
The Managed By contains the identity of the person responsible for the group. The Members
contains a list of names of users that belong to the group. This information is displayed based
on the default template associated with the group object class.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.16.jpg)

Figure 3. 16 : Search Results

To limit the number of profiles returned in your search:

1. Click the **Gear** button.
2. Enter a value in the Size Limit field.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Click Search.

### Basic Queries

A basic query allows either an LDAP filter (using the correct LDAP filter syntax) or full-text
search.

To define a new basic query:

1. Click the **Star** button. The window displays a list of saved queries and allows for creating new queries and editing existing queries.
2. Click the New button next to “basic queries”.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.17.jpg)

Figure 3. 17 : Saved Queries

3. Enter a name for the query.

>[!note] 
>It is recommended that query name indicate the parameters of the search (e.g. users located in Dallas in the AD Partner Domain).

4. Enter a query filter. This can be either an LDAP filter, or enter any value to invoke a full-text search.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.18.jpg)

Figure 3. 18 : Basic Query Editor

5. Click Save.

#### Full-text

Full-text search parameters are entered in the field on the main Global Identity Viewer page. A
query leveraging the RadiantOne Full-text functionality can be entered in different ways. If a
single word is entered (e.g. novato) there is a search across all entries/attributes and entries
that have an attribute that contains the word are returned.

In the following example, the request contains the following full-text value: novato

The selected entry contains the value Novato in the Address attribute.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.19.jpg)

Figure 3. 19 : Example Search Results of a Full-text Search

If two words are entered (e.g. Seattle Accounting) a search across all entries finds those that have attributes containing the words (at least one attribute that contains the word Seattle and one that contains the word Accounting). If you want to search for an entry that has a single attribute that contains both words, you must enter the value surrounded by double quotes (e.g. “Seattle Accounting”). This search would return entries that contain a single attribute that has the exact value of Seattle Accounting.

>[!warning] 
>Searches span across all user attributes from the underlying data source. This can be confusing because the template to display the results might not contain all attributes used in the search.

In the following image, the following full-text is performed.

```
Seattle accounting
```

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.20.jpg)

Figure 3.20: Example Search Results of a Full-text Search

The entries returned, like Charlene Tiu shown above, have attributes that contain “seattle” and attributes that have “accounting”. However, because the display template does not show the ou attribute (which contained a value of accounting in this example), it is impossible to know what underlying attribute matched the search.

#### LDAP Filter

LDAP Filter searches allow the user to type the search request (using LDAP filter syntax) in the search field, and the application executes the LDAP search against the selected data source. LDAP filter search request is entered in the “Enter a full-text search or LDAP filter” field on the search page. Saved LDAP filter searches are located under basic queries in the saved queries drop-down menu accessible by clicking the **Star** button. For instructions on defining an LDAP filter-based search, see [Defining a Basic Query](#advanced-queries).

In the following example, the Global Identity Viewer search option receives a request containing an LDAP filter as follows:

```
(&(objectclass=inetorgperson)(employeetype=intern))
```

All entries where objectclass=inetorgperson and employeetype=intern are returned.

>[!warning] 
>Searches span across all user attributes from the underlying directory. This can be confusing because the template to display the results might not contain all attributes used in the search.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.21.jpg)

Figure 3.21: Example Search Results

### Advanced Queries

This option allows the user to build an LDAP query with parameters or static values. Saved queries are located under advanced queries in the favorites menu which can be accessed by clicking the **Star** button.

To define an advanced query:

1. Click.
2. Click the New button next to “advanced queries”.

4. Enter a name for the query.

>[!note] 
>It is recommended that query name indicate the parameters of the search (e.g. Groups located in Dallas).

5. Select the data source the query is applicable to. This can be the global profile list, or any identity source configured in the Global Identity Builder project.
6. Select an attribute from the attribute drop-down menu.
7. Select a condition.
8. Select a parameter mode. The **Parameter Off** option does not allow modification of the search parameter value. To allow modifications to this query click **Parameter Off**. The search parameter toggles to **Parameter On**. This option allows user input, making it useful, for example, when you want to perform a series of searches, each with a slight modification.
9. (conditional) If parameter is off, enter a value for the attribute to condition the search.
10. (conditional) If parameter is on, enter a display name for the attribute that will be requested.
11. (optional) You can add or remove expressions and conditions. Each condition is a set of one or more expressions. To remove an expression, click the ![An image showing ](Media/button.jpg) button next to the expression.

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.24.jpg)

4. Click the Save button. To delete a query, click Edit, click Delete, and then click Yes to confirm the deletion.

### Voice to Text Queries

To speak a query, click the **Microphone** button on the search page. Voice commands must begin with by speaking the word “find”. When you begin a voice command with “find”, the search parameter field populates with what is spoken after the word “find”.

>[!note] 
>Verify that your microphone is enabled for use in your internet browser.

>**Activating the voice-to-text function in the Global Identity Viewer requires accessing the Identity Management Console over HTTPS.**

For example, the following spoken-word search performed.

```
“find 728”
```

The search returns entries that contain the value 728 as shown in the following image (e.g.
phone attribute).

![An image showing ](Media/Image3.28.jpg)

Figure 3. 28 : Example Result of Voice Search Query

To stop voice command detection in the Global Identity Viewer, say, “stop”.

### Saving Query Results

Global Identity Viewer search results can be exported in two ways. These options are described in this section.

#### Export Results

Global Identity Viewer search results can be exported to a PDF, CSV, or JSON file using the Export Results option.

To generate a report containing Global Identity Viewer search results:

1. (optional) Click the Export Settings button (![An image showing ](Media/Gear.jpg)). The Export Settings window displays.
